# SequentialRecommendationSystem

Welcome to the Sequential Recommendation System repository! This project is a straightforward recommendation system that utilizes PySpark and the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm to analyze user interests and provide movie recommendations based on their preferences.

## Overview

SequentialRecommendationSystem focuses on simplicity and efficiency in providing personalized movie recommendations. The ALS algorithm, implemented using PySpark, enables collaborative filtering to understand user preferences and suggest movies that align with their interests.

## Key Features

- **ALS Algorithm:** Leverage the power of collaborative filtering through the ALS algorithm to analyze and predict user preferences.

- **PySpark Integration:** Utilize PySpark for distributed computing, making it suitable for handling large datasets and scaling recommendations.

- **Simple Usage:** The system is designed to be easy to use. Users can quickly integrate the recommendation functionality into their applications or systems.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Sequential Recommendation System:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SequentialRecommendationSystem.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Directory Structure

- **src:** Contains the source code for the recommendation system, including the ALS algorithm implementation.
  
- **examples:** Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of the recommendation system with sample datasets.

## Usage

1. Import the recommendation system module.
2. Load your dataset and preprocess the data for PySpark ALS.
3. Train the recommendation model using the ALS algorithm.
4. Generate movie recommendations for users based on their preferences.
